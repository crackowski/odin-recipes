    <p>
        A <strong>steak</strong> is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across 
        the muscle fibers, sometimes including a bone. It is normally 
        grilled or fried. Steak can be diced, cooked in sauce, such as 
        in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such 
        as hamburgers.
