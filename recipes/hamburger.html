    <p>
        A <strong>hamburger</strong> is a sandwich consisting of a cooked meat patty
         on a bun or roll. You can order a hamburger, fries, and a 
         shake at most fast food restaurants. Hamburgers are 
         traditionally made with ground beef and served with 
         onions, tomatoes, lettuce, ketchup, and other garnishes.
